# Project Review Aggregator: iWanIt 1.0

**Author:** Aurèle Lambert  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** This repository is part of the IronHack AI Bootcamp and contains the implementation of the **iWanIt 1.0** project. The project aims to analyze product reviews and generate child-friendly sales pitches to help kids persuade parents to make purchases.

---

## Overview

iWanIt 1.0 is a prototype **mobile ad generator** designed to:
1. Analyze parent-written product reviews to identify the most persuasive arguments.
2. Organize and cluster products into meaningful categories.
3. Generate kid-friendly sales pitches that encourage parents to make purchases.

The system includes three main modules:
- **JoyScanner:** Sentiment analysis of reviews.
- **ToyFinder:** Product clustering based on categories.
- **BeggerMaker:** Generation of persuasive sales pitches.

## Features

### 1. JoyScanner
- **Purpose:** Analyzes the sentiment of product reviews to identify the most positive comments.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Used VADER for rule-based sentiment analysis (88.96% accuracy).
  - Used PySentimiento for transformer-based sentiment analysis (90.45% accuracy).
  - Calculates sentiment scores using both titles and reviews.

### 2. ToyFinder
- **Purpose:** Clusters products into categories for better targeting.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Preprocessed data (lemmatization, TF-IDF).
  - Experimented with 4 clustering methods; final model uses brand, name, and categories.
  - Created six clusters, e.g., "Kindles & e-readers," "Kids and toys."

### 3. BeggerMaker
- **Purpose:** Generates sales pitches tailored for children to persuade parents.
- **Implementation:**
  - Uses a fine-tuned **Llama 3.2** model with prompt engineering.
  - Prioritizes products based on ratings, reviews, and sentiment weights.
  - Generates child-like speech with elements of begging and urgency.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle Amazon reviews dataset.
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  1. Merged 3 CSV files containing 74k reviews.
  2. Removed duplicates and irrelevant data, resulting in 48k reviews.
  3. Added a sentiment score column and performed clustering on product names.
  4. Generated a final catalog with 81 unique products.

## Architecture

The project integrates sentiment analysis, clustering, and natural language generation. The system builds on existing tools and models, enhancing them for the project's goals.

## Demos

### Demo 1: Kindle
- **Child pitch:**  
  "Mom, I really want this Kindle. It’s perfect for reading because it’s small, the screen is bright, and it’s easy to use. It will last forever because the battery lasts 3 days. My friend Emily has one, and my grandma says it’s like reading a paper book. Can we please get one?"

### Demo 2: Paintball Gun
