I love that I completely control the content and time use. It's easy to use, and small enough for kids to hold. Great little tablet. Price was great! Can do almost anything on it just like an ipad but cheaper! Lol.... the only reason i bought this tablet was so i could load my games from my phone and play them on larger screen but i didnt realize that sonce its an amazon product it wont load google play or support vlash of clans or any other google game a big thumbs down.... i guess im just stuck with a tablet that is useless for me very good for an e-reader. does everything i want it to.

Great entertainment and easy to use. Great sound when playing music. The voice control is great. Took some time to get used to installing skills and specific phrases. Wasn't really sure of all of the capabilities and applications for the Echo, and I am still discovering them, but after a week or so I am happy with the product.

It's easy to read, it's easy to use, it's easy to read, it's easy to use, it's easy to read, it's easy to use, it's easy to read.

Durable. Nice that you don't have to download any software or block anything. Slow tho! I've bought 2 of these for my nephew and niece. They have great parental controls, wifi capable, plenty of space and you can switch out of kids mode if an adult wants to use it. Works well and fully functional. I would recommend. I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skills in counting and reading in English and foreign languages. She also enjoys having the tablet to read stories to her as it lights up the words for her to read along. She loves the ability to watch her favorite programs as well. This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase. My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes. I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational. My four year is very tech savvy better than some adults!Great for shaping her real world experiences. Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1 My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it. Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well My children love the tablet. It's a good price and the apps that come with it are great. Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis. This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set Purchased for my 5 year old. Love the echo dot sync I bought this product for my grandchildren. It is very easy for them to use and sturdy enough not to break when they drop it. Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it. Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good. this turned out to be everything I had hoped for.it is great. Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it. I love this! My Grand Daughter loves it when we are out and about she has something to show her how to learn things!\",\n          \"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip. This was purchased for my grandson. It has been easy for him to use. Love the parental controls and free time mode. The included bumper case is a bonus. A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use! My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying. I got this for my two grandsons (ages 2 & 4) for Christmas. They love them. I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands. I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all. I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup. Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick. Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love! My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions. Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics. Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver. I got this for my 3 year old after he broke my tablet. It is perfect for him! I love that it comes with all the games and apps. He has dropped it several times and no issues. Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet! Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends. Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.\",\n          \"Overall it's a nice looking cover and does it's job well. It's simple, elegant and slick. When I say slick, I don't necessarily mean cleverly devised, I mean slippery. The smooth leather provides next to no grip on the cover. I have a tendency to hold things lightly, so I can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand. Sure it doesn't have a band/clasp/etc to keep it closed, but neither did Kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.It's too expensive. I don't understand why Amazon is charging so much considering they'll be offering another cover with additional functionality for half the price (AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Touch, Kindle (Black)). What the heckPros:PrettyFunctionalCons:SlipperyExpensive So in reading the reviews before I got this cover I was quite worried... lots of people reported it feeling cheap, flimsy, overpriced etc. I was so concerned in fact I tried to cancel my order. I'm glad I wasn't able to.It is perhaps not what people expect- the leather is not soft, but is rather pressed and almost polished. However, this cover does NOT feel cheap to me. It is stylish, super light, and fits the kindle without those annoying elastic loops or hooks on the corners. It fits within a rubberized groove on the cover, which not only gives it a very tight and secure fit, it also adds protection to the corners of the device and cover. It also feels quite secure in the hand.So, to sum up: Light, secure, well made and unobtrusive. The 40 price tag could be debated, but I actually don't find it to be overpriced. I'm quite happy with it! I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never I bought one of the first Macs in the 80s. I've had 'too many to count since then.' I am an early adopter, by nature. This has been true of Amazon's Kindle product as well having owned the First Generation Kindle, K2, K3 and now the K Touch. Love the reader. And I love this case as well. I hear all of these complaints that this leather case looks cheap or doesn't have a closure, or it's too slippery. PLEASE. I find it to be a PERFECT fit for the Kindle Touch. The unit snaps in a la DoDo Case -- which is such a great product for iPad. Very similar design only on a much smaller scale, obviously. The leather is not an issue for me. I do NOT find it to be too slippery at all unless, perhaps, your hands are covered in oil This is a first class cover for a first class e-reader. And NO. I do not work for Amazon. I'm just a HUGE Kindle fan. The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. Okay, so I have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and I still want to rate it 3 and a half, but I have settled for 4 stars. Here is why.PROSThe only real reason I wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the Kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the Kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. It holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. The black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin (if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort) it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. Also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the Kindle has a case on.CONSMy main complaint is the quality of the leather. If you compare this to the case for the Kindle 3 (keyboard) the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. I sometimes lightly hold my Kindle between my\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Durable. Nice that you don't have to download any software or block anything. Slow tho! I've bought 2 of these for my nephew and niece. They have great parental controls, wifi capable, plenty of space and you can switch out of kids mode if an adult wants to use it. Works well and fully functional. I would recommend. I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skills in counting and reading in English and foreign languages. She also enjoys having the tablet to read stories to her as it lights up the words for her to read along. She loves the ability to watch her favorite programs as well. This was most definitely a worthwhile purchase. My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes. I really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case was a plus. But after setting this up and giving it to her it works like a dream. Great way to give a kid something both fun and educational. My four year is very tech savvy better than some adults!Great for shaping her real world experiences. Easy to use. Grandaughter was thrilled!!!!!!!!!!!1 My two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so I decided to get her a tablet. After looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. The preloaded apps are fun and educational. The ability to set daily time limits is great as I didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. Also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. Great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. Very pleased with it. Absolutely love this tablet. This is the second one we have purchased for our 1.5 year old. Our 3 year old has one as well My children love the tablet. It's a good price and the apps that come with it are great. Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis. This deal it very convenient for Little ones all in one set Purchased for my 5 year old. Love the echo dot sync I bought this product for my grandchildren. It is very easy for them to use and sturdy enough not to break when they drop it. Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it. Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good. this turned out to be everything I had hoped for.it is great. Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it. I love this! My Grand Daughter loves it when we are out and about she has something to show her how to learn things!\",\n          \"You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip. This was purchased for my grandson. It has been easy for him to use. Love the parental controls and free time mode. The included bumper case is a bonus. A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use! My son loves his tablet or at least that's what he calls it did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying. I got this for my two grandsons (ages 2 & 4) for Christmas. They love them. I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands. I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all. I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup. Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick. Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love! My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions. Its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics. Granddaughter loves it, easy for a toddler to hold and maneuver. I got this for my 3 year old after he broke my tablet. It is perfect for him! I love that it comes with all the games and apps. He has dropped it several times and no issues. Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet! Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them I bought these for my five and six-year-olds and they love the games and educational apps that come with it loaded from Amazon prime for free for a whole year. Great value for the money I will be referring this product to all of my friends. Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.\",\n          \"Overall it's a nice looking cover and does it's job well. It's simple, elegant and slick. When I say slick, I don't necessarily mean cleverly devised, I mean slippery. The smooth leather provides next to no grip on the cover. I have a tendency to hold things lightly, so I can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand. Sure it doesn't have a band/clasp/etc to keep it closed, but neither did Kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.It's too expensive. I don't understand why Amazon is charging so much considering they'll be offering another cover with additional functionality for half the price (AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Touch, Kindle (Black)). What the heckPros:PrettyFunctionalCons:SlipperyExpensive So in reading the reviews before I got this cover I was quite worried... lots of people reported it feeling cheap, flimsy, overpriced etc. I was so concerned in fact I tried to cancel my order. I'm glad I wasn't able to.It is perhaps not what people expect- the leather is not soft, but is rather pressed and almost polished. However, this cover does NOT feel cheap to me. It is stylish, super light, and fits the kindle without those annoying elastic loops or hooks on the corners. It fits within a rubberized groove on the cover, which not only gives it a very tight and secure fit, it also adds protection to the corners of the device and cover. It also feels quite secure in the hand.So, to sum up: Light, secure, well made and unobtrusive. The 40 price tag could be debated, but I actually don't find it to be overpriced. I'm quite happy with it! I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never I bought one of the first Macs in the 80s. I've had 'too many to count since then.' I am an early adopter, by nature. This has been true of Amazon's Kindle product as well having owned the First Generation Kindle, K2, K3 and now the K Touch. Love the reader. And I love this case as well. I hear all of these complaints that this leather case looks cheap or doesn't have a closure, or it's too slippery. PLEASE. I find it to be a PERFECT fit for the Kindle Touch. The unit snaps in a la DoDo Case -- which is such a great product for iPad. Very similar design only on a much smaller scale, obviously. The leather is not an issue for me. I do NOT find it to be too slippery at all unless, perhaps, your hands are covered in oil This is a first class cover for a first class e-reader. And NO. I do not work for Amazon. I'm just a HUGE Kindle fan. The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. Okay, so I have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and I still want to rate it 3 and a half, but I have settled for 4 stars. Here is why.PROSThe only real reason I wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the Kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the Kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. It holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. The black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin (if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort) it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. Also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the Kindle has a case on.CONSMy main complaint is the quality of the leather. If you compare this to the case for the Kindle 3 (keyboard) the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. I sometimes lightly hold my Kindle between my\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GPT summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Highly praised by users, this item excels in Great for the kids.

It's very convenient for me to read books and other study materials.The built-in backlight makes it simple to read at night! Like it! I am using my second kindle and this third one was a gift for my 83 year old mother in law, very user friendly This is awesome for reading. Much better to read than my iPad Mini 2. The refresh from page to page, or when you set a bookmark, is more annoying than using the Kindle app on the iPad Mini. But for reading books it is easy on my eyes and it can't be beat. I read in bed before going to sleep and I can fall asleep easier after using my Kindle than the iPad. Very useful. More better for reading than ipad. good for eyes This is my first kindle. Reading a book always been a pleasure but now is awesome. I love the Amazon White for its size and lighted screen. I bought myself a kindle earlier this summer and love it so much that I decided to get one for my ten year old. I thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative. She has responded surprisingly well. One feature that I really like is the dictionary. If she comes across a word she doesn't know or can't read, she can tap on it, and the dictionary will pop up defining the word. This enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better. This has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine. My 2nd generation Kindle finally died so I bought the Paperwhite as a replacement Love the size, weight, screen feel and best of all the backlighting. Can't go wrong with a Kindle Paperwhite! Exactly what was expected, easy to read, portable, good battery life. Has adds which are annoying but do not interfere with reading. Not idea for reading Manga or comics but works well enough. The Paperwhite is very convenient to use outside and inside, small enough to carry and great battery life. I had to replace a kindle I've had for years and this one fit the bill. The back-lighting is a huge plus as I didn't have it before, still on the slow side but works perfect when reading. It was so easy to set up the first time and add books. Easy to read clear screen and big words. Got this to replace my old 3G Kindle with Keyboard and it is great that I don't have to use a outside light to read after dark. Good job Amazon! I initially bought the paperwhite for myself, but gave it to my husband. I had read about the voyager, and they said it wasn't necessarily worth updating from the paperwhite, but if you were buying your first, go for it. It's a bit thinner and lighter, supposedly has a bit better font (don't know about that). I prefer this version of the kindle to the previous generation. It has a backlight that can be adjusted easily and its light weight. I did have a crack appear in my screen and it made the backlight shine through awfully bright in that area. Unsure how it happened but Amazon replaced it nonetheless. Great stuff for reading. I have been taking it everywhere with me. Reading is never more simple! The kindle is amazing and I love everything about it. Perfect size and readability and function for pages turning is comfortable The kindle paperwhits is great! It hold a charge for two weeks or more which is awesome. It's great to read in the sun and in darker areas or at night because of the backlit screen. Like how small and compact it is. Would def recommends getting one if you enjoy reading. i love my kindle. i use to have a nook but my kindle is so much nicer and easier to get b ooks.\",\n          \"Even when Im outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book Im reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isnt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes Im on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes Im sitting down. No matter what Im doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it wont allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its dual-battery charging\",\n          \"It's great, study enough to hold the beast.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
